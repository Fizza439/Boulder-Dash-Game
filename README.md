# Boulder-Dash-Game
This project is a simplified version of the classic Boulder Dash game, developed using NASM (Netwide Assembler) as part of a Computer Organization and Assembly Language course. The game includes three interactive levels, where the player navigates through obstacles, collects items (e.g., diamonds), and avoids falling boulders or getting trapped.

The game logic is implemented entirely in low-level x86 Assembly Language, showcasing concepts such as:

Memory management

Registers and stack usage

Keyboard input handling

Graphics rendering using interrupts (if graphical mode is used)

Control flow and logic without high-level structures

This project is a strong demonstration of how game mechanics like collision detection, object movement, level transitions, and user interaction can be built using assembly language principles. It reflects a solid understanding of hardware-near programming, making it a standout project for system-level learning.
